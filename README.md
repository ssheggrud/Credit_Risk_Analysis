# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

We were asked to look at the credit risk involved in the loan data provided to us in loan_stats.csv. This was done using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to create the models that we could then resample.

## Results:

After cleaning the data, we trained and tested it before oversampling.
